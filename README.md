# SENSOR-BASED-AUTOMATIC-PARKING-GATE-CROSSING-SYSTEM
A sensor-based automatic parking gate bar system that will open the bar whenever a vehicle is detected by a sensor and will turn on the LED light when the LDR sensor receives a small light intensity to help illuminate the parking area automatically when it is dark

Tools Needed 

Arduino Nano: Used as the central core of the project's system operator to read input from sensors and control the entire project
Infrared Sensor: Used to detect the entry and passage of vehicles past sensors installed near the bars 
Servo Motor: Used to move the door bar if it detects the Vehicle passing through the InfraRed Sensor
Jumper Cables: Jumper cables are used to connect electronic components on a breadboard or PCB
PCB Board: this is the circuit board used to connect the electronic components of this project
Male Header: this is a connector component used to connect wires or modules on a circuit board (PCB Board)
LDR Sensor: This sensor is used to capture the intensity of light, if the intensity of the captured light is small then it will turn on the LED Light
LED Light: This light is used to illuminate the parking area when in conditions where the LDR Sensor receives a small intensity of Light
